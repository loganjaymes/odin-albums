It features a young boy with short blonde hair in a white buttonup and black tie on the left, and a young girl in a white dress on the right. 
They are facing each other in a thorny forest and both holding a glowing white box. Above them is the band's name in an edgy font, with the subheading Selfish Machines under it."

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Selfish Machines is the sophomore album by the band Pierce the Veil, released on June 22, 2010. Vic Fuentes, 
    the band's frontman and rhythm guitarist, wrote a majority of the songs, and co-wrote a handful of them with 
    Tom Denney, a former member of A Day to Remember.

<p>
    Alongside Fuentes, Jeremy McKinnon of the previously mentioned A Day to Remember featured on the song "Caraphernelia", 
    becoming one of the band's biggest songs to date, and getting a music video as a result.
</p>
<p>The album itself is a blend of post-hardcore, emo, alternative, and, at times, latin music. The prior three genres are typical for the band, 
    however the final is most notable due to its relation, or lackthereof, to the former. This comes as a direct result to the members 
    themselves, as a majority of them come from latin, more specifically Mexican, heritage. This is especially seen in songs such as <em>"Besitos"</em>,
    of which is a Spanish phrase that literally translates to "kisses".
