# odin-albums
My first project within the free web-development course The Odin Project

Rather than doing the "recipes" project as intended, I decided to put my own spin on it and do albums instead.

**Instead of recipes:**

Image of the finished product -> Image of the album cover   
Recipe name -> Album title    
Description of the dish -> Blurb describing the album and the era of the band  
UL for ingredients -> UL for information, eg release date, genre, list of members   
OL for steps -> OL for tracklist
