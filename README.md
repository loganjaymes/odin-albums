# odin-albums
My first project within the free web-development course The Odin Project

Rather than doing the "recipes" project as intended, I decided to put my own spin on it and do albums instead.

<strong>Instead of recipes:</strong>

<br>Image of the finished product -> Image of the album cover </br>
<br>Recipe name -> Album title </br>
<br>Description of the dish -> Blurb describing the album and the era of the band </br>
<br>UL for ingredients -> UL for information, eg release date, genre, list of members </br>
<br>OL for steps -> OL for tracklist </br>
